# Matryoshka Doll

## Problem
> The problem for this forensic case is similar to the Information problem. We are given a jpg file of a matryoshka doll.

## Solution
1. Similarly to the cat.jpg i tried to see if i can find anything fishy in the properties of the file
2. Nothing unusual was found, so I turned the file into a txt file.
3. Nothing was readable or seemed to look like base64 so i tried changing the file again this time into a zip file
4. It turns out that once turning the file into a zip file, we are given another folder with another image with a matryoshka doll, so I repeated the process until it gave me the flag.txt file
5. Annoyingly, the flag had single spaces in between all the characters so I inputed the faulty flag into a space remover and got the flag

## Flag
