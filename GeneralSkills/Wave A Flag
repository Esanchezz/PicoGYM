# Wave a flag

## Problem
> In this problem we are given a program that isn't very readable when opened in the linux terminal.

## Solution
1. What I did first was open the file in the linux terminal but found that it wasn't very readable.
2. I changed the file in linux terminal by running the command "chmod +x warm" to add permission to execute as a program
3. To run file, i used ./warm to run warm in the current directory
4. The program tells me to use -h to learn more information about the program
