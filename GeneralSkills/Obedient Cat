## Problem
> This is probably the easiest problem on the site, but I started with this one to understand some simple linux commands

## Solution
1. I opened up my virtual box running kali linux
2. I copied the link that was titled "Download flag" https://mercury.picoctf.net/static/a5683698ac318b47bd060cb786859f23/flag
3. I opened the linux terminal and used the command wget https://mercury.picoctf.net/static/a5683698ac318b47bd060cb786859f23/flag to download the file flag
4. Used command open flag to see the picoCTF(flag)

## CTF flag
picoCTF{s4n1ty_v3r1f13d_4a2b35fd}
