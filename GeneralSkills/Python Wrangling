# Python Wrangling

## Problem
> In this problem I had to download 3 files: ende.py, flag.txt.en, and pw.txt. I needed to run the python file and give the proper password in order to get the flag

## Solution
1. Use linux terminal and run open '/root/Desktop/Picoctf General Skills/Python Wrangling/pw.txt' command to open the file pw.txt and retrieve pw key
2. Use linux terminal and run the command python ende.py -d flag.txt.en to run the python file in terminal
3. Paste the pw key to gain access to the picoctf(flag)

## CTF flag
picoCTF{4p0110_1n_7h3_h0us3_68f88f93}
